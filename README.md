# Developmental Disabilities Association

Our project for the Developmental Disabilities Association is a mobile application designed to help the developmentally disabled in their day jobs by giving them an approved set of tasks and instructions on how to complete them. Each set of jobs is assigned by their employers and DDA staff.

## My Responsibilities:

I am responsible for translating the entity-relationship diagram to a relational schema. Using SQL, I wrote queries to create database tables and inserted mocked data into them. I also designed the API by using Swagger Editor to write parameters and responses for each endpoint. Lastly, I am currently creating front-end components through React Native using HTML and styling them with CSS and Bootstrap.

## Credits:

Thanks to Code The Change Foundation for letting me develop my programming skills and using them for a good cause. Being in this club has shown me what it's like to use technologies for the betterment of our society. It not only gave me the knowledge and built confidence in my programming skills, but it also gave me a chance to give back to the community. 

I am also thankful to work alongside a team of talented individuals that share the same passion as I do. Working alongside them taught me the importance of teamwork and communication. Everyone is comfortable and always happy to help each other when problems arise. Our team also uses Slack to provide weekly updates and post questions when necessary. Each of us has an important role in this project and is working collectively to build a quality application.
